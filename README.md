# Pathfinding Visualizer

A simple C++/SFML application to visualize popular pathfinding algorithms like A* and Dijkstra's on a grid.

## Features
- Interactive grid creation (walls, start, end points)
- Visual step-by-step exploration of algorithms
- Reset and clear grid functionality

## Built With
- C++
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)

## To-Do
- [ ] A* algorithm
- [ ] Dijkstra's algorithm
- [ ] BFS algorithm
- [ ] Weighted terrain
- [ ] Maze generation

## Getting Started
1. Install SFML
2. Build with CMake (or set up your IDE project)
3. Run and interact with the visualizer
